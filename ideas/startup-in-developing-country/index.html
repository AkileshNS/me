    <h1 class="title">Start Startup in a Developing Country</h1>
    <p>Building a startup in a country with nearly no infrastructure has some challenges.
It can be difficult to find good employees and paying costumers.
But it has some advantages too.</p>

<p>The sallaries are low and there is not much competition.</p>

<p>You could start the project by collecting donations
with the help of platforms like kickstarter.com and betterplace.org.
People could donate their old Hardware too.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t search for employees but for local talents instead.
They do not need experience in software development.
Search for young, smart people instead.</p>

<p>The first phase of the project would be to teach your new emploees in the areas they’re most talented in.
And as soon as you have a small team you could start earning money.</p>

<p>If there is now interest for software developers by local businesses
you still can do work for international businesses or be creative
and invest time in platforms like <a href="http://themeforest.net/">http://themeforest.net/</a>.</p>
