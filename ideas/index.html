    <h1 class="intro">Some Stuff I Want <i>You</i> to Build</h1>
</div>


    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/interactive-ads/">
            <h2 class="title">Interactive Public Advertisment</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Sure, advertisment works. But its 2014. We have advertisment movies on every second public square and even in the underground.
<br>
But it feels like TV, like last century.
<br>
Why is public advertisment not social yet?
<br>
It should be quiet simple to display an QR code and let people tweet something to the companies account
and integrate it live into the advertisment running on the screen.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/nice-aircon/">
            <h2 class="title">Good Looking Air Con</h2>
        </a>
        <p>It&rsquo;s totally understandable that not everyone can affort a fancy Air Con system
that&rsquo;s completely invisible. Some people may also decide to get an AC later on.</p>

<p>But does an AC have to look ugly? Why can&rsquo;t they at least paint them with some nice colors?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/avatar-messenger/">
            <h2 class="title">Messenger App Alternative With Cute Avatar</h2>
        </a>
        <p>You can choose a cute avatar.</p>

<p>And instead of using smileys to show emotions your avatar can do some cool moves.</p>

<p>You also should be able to send text via speech bubbles.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/streetart-ads/">
            <h2 class="title">Streetart Ads</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Company you can anonymously contact to make outdoor advertisement.
Graffiti, stickers, flyers, posters, performance, …</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/toilet-dj/">
            <h2 class="title">Toilet DJ</h2>
        </a>
        <p>I would me so much more willing to give someone standing in front of a toilet money
if the person would have a little DJ table
and I could enjoy some music in there.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/adventures-in-sandwich-land/">
            <h2 class="title">Adventure in Sandwich Land</h2>
        </a>
        <p>I would love to see someone starting a blog about what is possible to do with a sandwich.</p>

<p>There are basically no limits what you use a sandwich maker for.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/beer-ice-mixer/">
            <h2 class="title">Bier and Ice in Mixer</h2>
        </a>
        <p>I just wonder what it tastes like if you put beer and ice cubes in a mixer.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/not-naked/">
            <h2 class="title">The Not Naked Nudist Movie</h2>
        </a>
        <p>A little challenge for a filmmaker:</p>

<p>Make a movie where no person wears anything for the whole movie.</p>

<p>However, you should never see certain parts of the body.</p>

<p>Also, watchers shouldn’t realise no one wears clothes.
It should just feel like any other movie.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/livecam-shop/">
            <h2 class="title">Online Shop via Live Cam</h2>
        </a>
        <p>If you have a local store and also want to sell stuff online
you could do so by simple installing some web cams in your store.</p>

<p>This way people would see what you sell.
Or if you already have an existing online shop you could make different parts
of the web cam picture clickable and connect it to the products in the online shop.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/local-alarm/">
            <h2 class="title">Local Alarm</h2>
        </a>
        <p>I would like to have an app where you can mark an area on a map
and as soon as you get into the area an alarm will be triggered.</p>

<p>This would be helpful for example if fall asleep while driving home from a long night.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/dark-party/">
            <h2 class="title">Party in the Dark</h2>
        </a>
        <p>There is stuff like dining in the dark but have you ever been to a party in a completely dark room?</p>

<p>I am wondering with what ways of communicating people would come up with.</p>

<p>You also could have some guards watching the hole thing with night vision cameras.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/monsterrun/">
            <h2 class="title">Templerun from the Monsters Point of View</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be interesting to play a Monster chaising people?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/stranger-party/">
            <h2 class="title">Party of Stranger</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Throw a Party where no one is allowed to bring someone he knows.
    So there are only strangers.
    Could be interesting.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/desease-3d-model/">
            <h2 class="title">3D Model to Find out About Diseases</h2>
        </a>
        <p>A website or app where you have a 3D model of the human body.</p>

<p>You can click on any part of the body and get a list of possible diseases in this area.</p>

<p>Additionally there could be information for each disease on how to heal it.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/startrek-computer/">
            <h2 class="title">Startrek-like Computer</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Actually it is pretty easy to enable your own computer to talk with you.
Checkout the Web Speech APi:
<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html</a>.</p>

<p>The voice recognition is pretty good already.</p>

<p>Now you only have to setup hubot (<a href="http://hubot.github.com/">http://hubot.github.com/</a>)
and you have a really big palette of command available:
<a href="https://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/">https://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be that hard to write a little web app sending requests to hubot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Web Speech API only available in Chrome yet. Would be even more fun on mobile.</p>

<p>btw: Did you ever clicked the little microphone in the google search field (only in Chrome)?
Just tell her “make me a sandwich” :)</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/live-slides/">
            <h2 class="title">Online Slides for Presentation</h2>
        </a>
        <p>When you listen to a talk at a conference a lot of speakers post their slides online after the talk.
But it would be even more useful to have the slides available already while she’s talking.
You could automate the hole thing so that every time you open a new slide it gets public visible.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/remote-alarm-clock/">
            <h2 class="title">Remote Alarm Clock</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Remote Alarm Clock would be an app for your phone.
You could give one person the permission to wake you up
and he could trigger the alarm from using phone.</p>

<p>And it would also be better than just calling someone
because you can insure that only one specific person is able to interrupt you.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/mail-to-email/">
            <h2 class="title">Send Mail to an Email Address</h2>
        </a>
        <p>It would be awesome if you could just put an e-mail address on a postcard
or a letter instead of a real address.</p>

<p>You would not have to remember the address of someone if you want to send him something.</p>

<p>The post office could just send an e-mail to the given e-mail address
and ask for a real address to deliver the mail to.</p>

<p>This way you could send postcards to people back home from your holidays
without asking them for their address and
it also would be useful the other way around:
you don’t have to give someone your real address to get mail.</p>

<p>Furthermore it’s also handy for people who travel a lot:
they could just choose a new address for every single delivery.</p>

<p>The problem is that you only can realize this idea if you are a mail delivery company.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/nosql-excel/">
            <h2 class="title">Excel Replacement in a JSON / NoSQL Way</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Excel has been the only choice for a lot of office work for the last years.</p>

<p>But maybe some tasks Excel is used for could be accomblished way easier
if there would be a more flexible tool that would not force you to use tables for everything.</p>

<p>This would be like nosql technologies as alternative to sql databases.</p>

<p>The data could be stored in json instead of the annoying .csv format
and macros could be written in a modern scripting language like Javascript instead of Visualbasic.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of things that could be improved in Excel
and its a pitty that even if so many people’s work life depends on this tool
there is not much effort put into improving it.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/startup-in-developing-country/">
            <h2 class="title">Start Startup in a Developing Country</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Building a startup in a country with nearly no infrastructure has some challenges.
It can be difficult to find good employees and paying costumers.
But it has some advantages too.</p>

<p>The sallaries are low and there is not much competition.</p>

<p>You could start the project by collecting donations
with the help of platforms like kickstarter.com and betterplace.org.
People could donate their old Hardware too.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t search for employees but for local talents instead.
They do not need experience in software development.
Search for young, smart people instead.</p>

<p>The first phase of the project would be to teach your new emploees in the areas they’re most talented in.
And as soon as you have a small team you could start earning money.</p>

<p>If there is now interest for software developers by local businesses
you still can do work for international businesses or be creative
and invest time in platforms like <a href="http://themeforest.net/">http://themeforest.net/</a>.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/discworld-game/">
            <h2 class="title">Discworld MMORPG</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The Discworld is awesome. I’m sure gamers love it, too.
Unfortunately the latest Discworld game was released already more than ten years ago.</p>

<p>Why does no one build an MMORPG based on the Discworld?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/phoneboard/">
            <h2 class="title">Your Mobile Phone is a Skateboard</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Did you ever found yourself throwing your phone in the air
and trying to do some tricks you remember from the times you where out there with your skateboard?
( by out there I ‘m of course talking about  the streets of Tony Hawks Pro Skater )</p>

<p>Why don’t you try to use the capabilities of your phone
to recognise the movements of your phone and build an awesome game with that?</p>

<p>This would be an exciting game.
You really have to have balls to throw your 700€ IPhone into the air!</p>

    <div class="box">
        <a href="http://jorin.in/ideas/hitchhikers-guide/">
            <h2 class="title">Make “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” Become True</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Wikipedia already is a great encyclopedia but the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
is way more entertaining because it presents the content with videos.</p>

<p>To build a encyclopedia as big as Wikipedia everyone should be able to contribute.
Therefore there should be some tools available to easily produce great animated content.
It would be even better if you could use the hole power of the web
and create an interactive experience with tools
like Mozilla’s Popcorn Maker (<a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/">https://popcorn.webmaker.org/</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyYS-GzBSIg">Here is an example for the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a></p>
