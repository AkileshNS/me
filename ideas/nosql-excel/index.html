    <h1 class="title">Excel Replacement in a JSON / NoSQL Way</h1>
    <p>Excel has been the only choice for a lot of office work for the last years.</p>

<p>But maybe some tasks Excel is used for could be accomblished way easier
if there would be a more flexible tool that would not force you to use tables for everything.</p>

<p>This would be like nosql technologies as alternative to sql databases.</p>

<p>The data could be stored in json instead of the annoying .csv format
and macros could be written in a modern scripting language like Javascript instead of Visualbasic.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of things that could be improved in Excel
and its a pitty that even if so many peopleâ€™s work life depends on this tool
there is not much effort put into improving it.</p>
