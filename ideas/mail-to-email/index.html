    <h1 class="title">Send Mail to an Email Address</h1>
    <p>It would be awesome if you could just put an e-mail address on a postcard
or a letter instead of a real address.</p>

<p>You would not have to remember the address of someone if you want to send him something.</p>

<p>The post office could just send an e-mail to the given e-mail address
and ask for a real address to deliver the mail to.</p>

<p>This way you could send postcards to people back home from your holidays
without asking them for their address and
it also would be useful the other way around:
you don’t have to give someone your real address to get mail.</p>

<p>Furthermore it’s also handy for people who travel a lot:
they could just choose a new address for every single delivery.</p>

<p>The problem is that you only can realize this idea if you are a mail delivery company.</p>
