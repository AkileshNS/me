title: Using Computers For Good

How about focusing on doing something good with our work instead of focusing on money for a change?<!--more-->


Most companies in the tech industry are heavily money ðŸ’° driven.
These companies make ðŸ’° money by tricking their users to use their product for longer.
Or they make money ðŸ’° by collecting as much data as possible about their users.
For me this is the exact opposite of what computers are supposed to do.
Computers should do the work for us, so we humans can spend our time doing more interesting things.
And a good program should depend on as little information as possible, instead of being unnecessary complex.
How much good could we do if we focus more on creating something actually useful instead of focusing on ðŸ’°?
