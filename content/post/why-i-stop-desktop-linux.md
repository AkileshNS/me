  I have been using Linux for a while now. It's almost there. But not yet.
title: Why I stop using Linux on my desktop
---

I have been running Linux on my Macbook exclusively for a year now.

In my opinion Macbooks are still the best hardware around.

But by using an OS not made for the hardware I have to deal with small problems popping up all the time:
Broken hibernation mode, complete freeze when running out of memory, problems with WiFi, random graphic glitches, ... - Nothing big but they add up.

Also, for professional use I like to be compatible with what others around me use.
Broken Skype and a lot of missing desktop apps make working with others more difficult.

I'm impressed how far Linux on desktop already got. Unfortunately it has many small issues other platforms don't have.

One big step to fix a lot of this issues would be to create dedicated hardware that is specifically indented to run Linux.

I don't want to give up on Desktop Linux and I'm hoping to see things getting better in the future!
