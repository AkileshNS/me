  The other day I was on my way home, sitting on the subway.
  At the next stop a guy got in and sat down next to me.
title: A Subway Ride Home

He seemed a bit stressed or even paranoid judging from the way he was looking around the train.
Right after sitting down he took his laptop out of his backpack.

It caught my eyes because of the stickers on it.
At this point, I think, subconsciously I became a little suspicious already. It was not a Macbook.
It was a rather big, black laptop with sharp edges.

My suspicion got confirmed when I saw a Linux desktop on the screen.

He quickly opened up a terminal. That made me rather excited to witness what will happen next.

Appropriately he started typing "ifconfig", looking at the output shortly, then entering "clear" and the terminal was empty again.

All this appeared to me like a rather unusual thing to do while sitting in a packed rush hour train.

Next he opened a Shell script with the default text editor, black-on-white.
Shortly after he switched back to the green-on-black terminal, opening the same file over there.
Using "nano". I was a little bit disappointed.

Now I had a chance to peek at the script.
The file was several hundreds, if not thousands lines long. It was a Shell script.

There seemed to be a lot of "if" statements with hard-coded values.

It was shocking to see someone can manage to work on something like this.
Maybe also impressive. To cope with this, you definitely need a better-working brain then mine.
Unfortunately it happens way too many times that we have to deal with systems that grew into suboptimal shapes over time.

I was more surprised when I realized the content this script was dealing with.
All the words in this script were biological and chemical terms.

He was mostly busy opening different files, reading code.
Looking around the train, left, right. Then running "ifconfig" again.
Switching back to the code. Changing something.

Now he was typing the file path for the script to  launch it from the command line.

Then there was the PA voice. This was my station.

Time to get of the train.

I hope I never find out what this was about.
