This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Pixyll](http://www.pixyll.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Thank you open source!

## Licensing

- The code can is [MIT](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) as [Pixyll](http://www.pixyll.com).

## Development

### Installing Jekyll

By using the Github Pages gem I can be sure it looks the same as in production.
Just run:

    bundle


### Jekyll Serve

    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

This ensures the same setup as on Github Pages is used locally.
Now you can navigate to [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to see the site.
