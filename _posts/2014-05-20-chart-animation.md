title: Chart Animation with SVG and jQuery
summary: >
  I built a simple SVG chart including animations with pure SVG
  and it's not as difficult as you might think.

SVG is an underrated tool. It seems people are more exited about Canvas because it's simple.
But SVG lets you do a lot of things with way less effort.
It's just scary because it's so powerful.

Normally when I should do something in SVG I automatically start thinking about which library to use this time.
But for most simple stuff (like charts) you don't even need a library.
All the styling can be done in CSS. And you can dynamically manipulate it with jQuery.
Sounds familiar? - SVG just works like the DOM you're used to work with!
Look at this nice, animated graph below. Doesn't it look like normal jQuery code?
You can just start using SVG with your existing tools.
Don't be afraid of SVG. Canvas is not always the easier option for grafics.
