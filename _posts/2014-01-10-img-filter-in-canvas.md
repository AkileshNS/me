title:      Image Filtering Using a Canvas Element
summary:    I implemented a few image filters in a canvas element.

Normally we don't need to implement our own filters.
Photoshop does a way better job than we could.
But someone has to build Photoshop and the camera app on your phone, right?

As a web developer it might also be interesting to know how filtering actually works.
It's always good to understand the tools you work with
and filters are part of the web now with the latest SVG and CSS updates.

So here are some basic filters implemented manually with just Javascript and the `<canvas>` element:

<script data-slug-hash="eFlkh" data-user="jorin" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-theme-id="8862" class='codepen' async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" ></script>

You can test the different filters and look at the code.
It might surprise you how little code is neccessary.
Feel free to play around and create some nice filters!
