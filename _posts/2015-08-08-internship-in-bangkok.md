  A summary of what it's like to do an internship in Bangkok, Thailand.
---

A part of my studies in university is to do an internship abroad for one semester.

For some personal reasons I chose Bangkok, Thailand as my destination.

It was not that difficult to find an international tech company over there where I was welcome.
Even though the  startup scene is not as big as in other cities,
Bangkok is still big enough to have a few startups with an international team where where English is the common language.

I applied with the usual procedure including a form on their website, a CV, a [Github][gh] link, a link to my [blog][blog] and multiple Skype interviews.

Next step was to get all the paperwork figured out to apply for a visa.
I received a temporary contract via E-mail and applied for a three months visa.

Arriving in Thailand, I still had a couple of days to get settled.
Luckily it was not my first time there and I even had a place to stay.

However, for a European person it's not that difficult to find a flat there.
And living is affordable compared to European cities.
For 200-300 euros you can get your own apartment already (including a swimming pool).

The general cost of living is also lower than in Europe.
You can have a meal in the street for less than one euro.
A little bit more pricey restaurants are also affordable.
Because of this, you won't find yourself cooking much anymore.
Only if you plan to go out (and drink) a lot you have to expect to spend at least as much as in Germany.
Also, since there are many nice places close by, you might spend a bit for traveling.

Just keep in mind that the compensation for your work might also be quite low as an intern,
if you get anything.
But that's understandable in a country where a big part of the population earns less than 8 euros for a 10 hours day of working.
A junior software developer here is lucky if she gets a thousand euros in a month which is already considered a lot compared to other fields (which also require a university degree).

I still had some savings left and I didn't need more than 600 euros in a month to live a comfortable life.

The biggest obstacle for my internship was the extension of my initial three months visa.

Luckily I had help from my company. But dealing with Thai bureaucracy was not really a pleasant experience.

Apparently it's not that difficult to get a normal working visa or even a visa for studying - Only visas for internships seem not that common.

- I had to to apply for a working permit at the Department of Labor.
- Then, I had to talk to my German university to send me a recommendation letter in the original paper version,
which either takes a whole month or you pay 80 euros for express mail (which still takes a week).
- Next I needed to go to the German embassy and request another recommendation letter (and pay for it).
- The office to apply for the actual visa is outside the city and I had to go there early in the morning to queue up for 5 hours.
- Unfortunately the first time I went there some papers were missing and I had to do this twice.
However, it finally worked.

Apart from that everything worked well and I think it's was a good experience.
