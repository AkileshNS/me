title: Ruby Makes Writing Scripts Fun
summary: >
  This is an example for a script that might be too complex
  to enjoy writing it as shell script
  and how Ruby can help you to keep it simple.

Writing short automation scripts is a common task.
But figuring out the right shell script syntax can be a daunting task.

Fortunately Ruby has really well designed System APIs
and comes with all the tools you need.

Even better is that the focus on usability also
extends to third-party modules and you have a big community
providing you everything you need.

Another nice thing about Ruby is that you don't need to look up
APIs that ofen because they work exactly the way you would expect them to.


Here is a short script to take some screenshots of a video collection:
